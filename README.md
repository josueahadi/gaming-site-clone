# LUGX Gaming - Site Clone
A landing page design with Tailwind CSS <br>
## Get Started
1. git clone https://github.com/josueahadi/gaming-site-clone.git
2. Run <code> npm install </code>

    This command will download all dependencies defined in the `package. json` file and generates a `node_modules folder` with the installed modules.


#### Alternatively

1. git clone https://github.com/josueahadi/gaming-site-clone.git
2. Set up tailwind css with vite before doing anything else. Follow this page for instructions on how to setup and configure tailwind: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-setup-tailwind-css-with-vite/
3. Have fun :)

Note: There are plenty of ways in which you can accomplish this but my personal recommendation is with vite.
